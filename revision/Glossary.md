# Immutable
 An object with a fixed value. Immutable objects include `numbers`, `strings` and `tuples`. Such an object cannot be altered.
 
  A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored. They play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary.

# Mutable
Mutable objects can change their value but keep their `id()`

# Iterable
An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include all sequence types (such as `list`, `str`, and `tuple`) and some non-sequence types like `dict`, `file objects`, and `objects of any classes you define with an __iter__() method` or with a \__getitem__() method that implements sequence semantics.
